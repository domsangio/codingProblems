1. We are playing a game with a 10 sided die and all we have is a 6 sided die. How can you use this die to play the game in as few rolls as possible?

2. You are given a 30 sided die. Every time you roll you get the money on the die. The game ends when you roll a number that shares a common factor with any of the previous rolls, ie. 1, 2, 4 [ends because 4]. What is the largest sum you can obtain in this game? [The sum doesn't matter as much, what are the numbers?]

3. We have a game where you win when there are two more heads and you lose when there are two more tails. You initially bet 10$ (win 10 or lose 10). At any point you can double the bet before the coin flip. How much would you pay for the game?
